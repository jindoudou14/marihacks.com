            Mentor registration opens February 16th 2026 and closes March 29th 2026 at 11:59pm! MariHacks is open to programmers of
            any level, and we encourage participants to try out new programming
            fields and techniques! That being said, our hackathon strives to
            inspire learning, innovation and collaboration, which would not be
            possible without mentors. If you are an experienced programmer in
            one or more domains who loves to help others, we would love to have
            you!
